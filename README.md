# React E-Commerce with Strapi
I have successfully completed an e-commerce project, which is a dynamic online store allowing products to be added, modified, or deleted seamlessly from the server side.
In this project, I leveraged my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and explored new frameworks such as Material UI and Framer Motion to create engaging animations and user experiences.
#Frontend:
•	Technologies Used: React + Vite
•	UI/UX Enhancements: Implemented animations using Framer Motion and ensured responsiveness and aesthetics with Material UI.
•	Features: Developed a dark mode toggle and a scroll button using custom hooks like useScrollTrigger().
#Backend:
•	CMS: Strapi, a headless CMS, for managing product data.
•	Database: PostgreSQL for robust data management.
•	Image Handling: Integrated Cloudinary for efficient image storage and management.
•	Data Fetching: Connected frontend and backend using RTK Query.
•	Hosting: Deployed frontend on Firebase and backend on Render server, ensuring smooth API communication.
#Key Learnings and Achievements:
•	Mastered the integration of various technologies to build a full-stack application.
•	Enhanced user interface with dynamic content management and animations.
•	Implemented modern development practices and tools to ensure scalability and maintainability.
